# Strongly Weakly type Language
>TODO [Static/Dynamic vs Strong/Weak](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2351190/static-dynamic-vs-strong-weak)
>-   _Static/Dynamic Typing_ is about **when** type information is acquired (Either at compile time or at runtime)  
>-   _Strong/Weak Typing_ is about **how strictly** types are distinguished (e.g. whether the language tries to do an implicit conversion from strings to numbers).
